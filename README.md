Create wireframes for your app’s **main ejs pages**.
- index.ejs (see all items)
- new.ejs (form to create item)
- show.ejs (item detail page)
- edit.ejs  (form to edit item)

### ✅ **3. ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) ↔️**
Draw an **ERD** showing your app's **models** and how they **connect**.

<br />

User has many listings.  Listings **reference** the user.

## **Table of RESTful Routes**
| HTTP Method| RESTful Route          | Controller Function       |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET        | `/resources`           | `myCtrl.index()`          |
| GET        | `/resources/new`       | `myCtrl.newResource()`    |
| POST       | `/resources`           | `myCtrl.create()`         |
| GET        | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.show()`           |
| DELETE     | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.destroy()`        |
| GET        | `/resources/:id/edit`  | `myCtrl.edit()`           |
| PUT        | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.update()`         |


Example: If your app tracks **applications**, replace `resources` with `applications`.

  - User: username, password
  - Book: title, author, status: "reading", "completed", "wishlist"
- **Workout Logger:** Users save workout history.
  - User: username, password
  - Workout: exercise name, reps, sets, date
- **Task Manager:** Users create tasks.
  - User: username, password
  - Task: task name, description, due date, completion status
- **Journal App:** Users create journal entries.
  - User: username, password
  - JournalEntry: title, content, date
- **Budget Tracker:** Users log (save) expenses.
  - User: username, password
  - Expense: amount, category, description, date
- **Social Media Mini-app:** Users create text or image posts.
