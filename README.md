You will submit a **public Trello board** that includes the following:

### âœ… **1. MVP User Stories**


### âœ… **2. Wireframes**
Create wireframes for your appâ€™s **main ejs pages**.
- index.ejs (see all items)
- new.ejs (form to create item)
- show.ejs (item detail page)
- edit.ejs  (form to edit item)

### âœ… **3. ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**
Draw an **ERD** showing your app's **models** and how they **connect**.  

## **Examples of Each Requirement**

## **Table of RESTful Routes**
| HTTP Method| RESTful Route          | Controller Function       |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET        | `/resources`           | `myCtrl.index()`          |
| GET        | `/resources/new`       | `myCtrl.newResource()`    |
| POST       | `/resources`           | `myCtrl.create()`         |
| GET        | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.show()`           |
| DELETE     | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.destroy()`        |
| GET        | `/resources/:id/edit`  | `myCtrl.edit()`           |
| PUT        | `/resources/:id`       | `myCtrl.update()`         |


Example: If your app tracks **applications**, replace `resources` with `applications`.

## Project Ideas (Simple CRUD Apps)

Here are some ideas for projects where a **user owns many** of **one resource**:

- **Book Tracker:** Users save books to read.
- **Task Manager:** Users create tasks.
- **Movie Watchlist:** Users save watched movies.
- **Users & Bookmarks:** Users save favorite articles
- **Users & Events:** Users create and manage events

---

## **Stretch Goal User Stories**
- **As a user, I want to favorite a [resource].**
- **As a user, I want to upload an image for my [resource].**
- **As a guest, I want to change the site to dark mode.**
- **As a user, I want to add a comment to a [resource].**
- **As a user, I want to search for [resources].**

These are **optional** but add extra value to your project.
